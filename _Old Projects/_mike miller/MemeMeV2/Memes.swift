//this class below encapsulates a thread-safe singleton instance of type [MemeObjects] which can be shared/accessed across view controllers and will hold the saved memed images (as an alternative approach to using the app delegate to store a single instance of an object); the singleton is also what is updated and saved to disk when a new meme is added to or deleted from the array, and is set to the saved meme data on the file disk when the app is first launched

class Memes {
    static let sharedInstance = Memes()
    var savedMemes = [MemeObject]()
    
    private init() { }
}
